# üîß User Telegram ID Setup Guide

## Issue Identified
User **"man davra"** has completed all steps but their Telegram ID is not set, which means:
- ‚úÖ Payment completed (Pro plan, 30 days)
- ‚úÖ KYC completed
- ‚ùå Telegram ID not set (bot can't track them)

## Solution Steps

### For the User (man davra):

1. **Get Telegram User ID:**
   - Open Telegram
   - Search for `@userinfobot`
   - Send any message to the bot
   - The bot will reply with your Telegram User ID (e.g., `123456789`)

2. **Set Telegram ID in the system:**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:5173/telegram-id`
   - Enter your Telegram User ID
   - Click "Update Telegram ID"

### For Admin (Manual Update):

If the user can't access the frontend, you can manually update their Telegram ID:

```javascript
// In MONGODB shell or using the script:
User.findByIdAndUpdate('6889a69bab4635b5e5fe278a', { 
  telegramUserId: 'USER_TELEGRAM_ID_HERE' 
})
```

### Current User Details:
- **User ID:** `6889a69bab4635b5e5fe278a`
- **Name:** man davra
- **Email:** mandavra12@gmail.com
- **Phone:** 8140241212
- **Telegram ID:** NOT SET
- **Plan:** Pro (30 days)
- **Expiry:** August 30, 2025

## Why This Matters

Without the Telegram ID:
- The bot can't track the user in the Telegram channel
- The user won't be kicked when their subscription expires
- The admin panel won't show proper user status

## Next Steps

1. Ask the user to get their Telegram ID from @userinfobot
2. Guide them to `/telegram-id` page or manually update the database
3. Once set, the bot will be able to track and manage their membership

## Verification

After setting the Telegram ID, run:
```bash
node check-all-users.js
```

This should show the Telegram ID as set instead of "NOT SET".
