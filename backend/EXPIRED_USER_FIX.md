# Expired User Kick Fix

## Problem Description

A user with ID `6889a69bab4635b5e5fe278a` had an expired subscription (expiry_date: `2025-07-30T03:14:00.850Z`) but was not kicked from the Telegram channel. The user's payment link data shows:

```json
{
  "_id": "6889aa19945b16c22a7d2470",
  "userid": "6889a69bab4635b5e5fe278a",
  "plan_name": "Pro",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "expiry_date": "2025-07-30T03:14:00.850Z",
  "duration": 30
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Cron Job Issue**: The `kickExpiredUsers` function in `server.js` was only looking for users with `status: 'SUCCESS'` and expired `expiry_date`
2. **Missing Users**: If a user's subscription expired but the status wasn't updated properly, they wouldn't be found by the kick job
3. **Manual Intervention Needed**: The specific user needed to be kicked manually

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Kick Function (`server.js`)

Modified the `kickExpiredUsers` function to find expired users regardless of their status:

```javascript
// Before: Only checked SUCCESS status
const expiredUsers = await PaymentLink.find({
    status: 'SUCCESS',
    expiry_date: { $lt: now }
}).populate('userid');

// After: Checks both SUCCESS and any expired users
const expiredUsers = await PaymentLink.find({
    $or: [
        { status: 'SUCCESS', expiry_date: { $lt: now } },
        { expiry_date: { $lt: now } } // Also check any expired users regardless of status
    ]
}).populate('userid');
```

### 2. Manual Kick Scripts

Created several scripts to handle expired users:

#### `kick-expired-user.js`
- Kicks the specific expired user mentioned in the query
- Requires environment variables (BOT_TOKEN, CHANNEL_ID, MONGODB_URI)

#### `fix-expired-users.js`
- Comprehensive script to find and kick all expired users
- Provides detailed logging and summary
- Handles errors gracefully

#### `debug-expired-user.js`
- Debug script to check expired user data without kicking
- Useful for troubleshooting

### 3. Admin API Endpoint

Added a new admin endpoint to manually trigger the kick job:

```
POST /api/admin/trigger-kick-job
```

This allows administrators to manually trigger the kick job without restarting the server.

### 4. Trigger Script

Created `trigger-kick-job.js` to easily trigger the kick job via API call.

## Usage Instructions

### To Fix the Specific User

1. **Set up environment variables** in your `.env` file:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_MONGODB_connection_string
   BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
   CHANNEL_ID=your_telegram_channel_id
   ```

2. **Run the specific user kick script**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node kick-expired-user.js
   ```

### To Fix All Expired Users

1. **Run the comprehensive fix script**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node fix-expired-users.js
   ```

### To Trigger Kick Job via API

1. **Make sure server is running**

2. **Trigger the kick job**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node trigger-kick-job.js
   ```

   Or manually call:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/trigger-kick-job
   ```

### To Debug Expired Users

1. **Run the debug script**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node debug-expired-user.js
   ```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Enhanced Cron Job**: The improved `kickExpiredUsers` function now catches all expired users
2. **Better Logging**: Added more detailed logging to track kick operations
3. **Manual Triggers**: Admin endpoints for manual intervention when needed
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and reporting

## Monitoring

The system now provides:
- Detailed logs for each kick operation
- Summary reports of kick results
- Error notifications for failed kicks
- Admin panel notifications via Socket.IO

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `backend/server.js` - Enhanced kick function and added admin endpoint

### New Files:
- `backend/kick-expired-user.js` - Specific user kick script
- `backend/fix-expired-users.js` - Comprehensive fix script
- `backend/debug-expired-user.js` - Debug script
- `backend/trigger-kick-job.js` - API trigger script
- `backend/EXPIRED_USER_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps

1. Run the appropriate script to fix the current expired user
2. Monitor the enhanced cron job to ensure it catches future expired users
3. Use the admin endpoint for manual intervention when needed
4. Consider setting up monitoring alerts for failed kick operations
